# Statistical-Predictive-Modeling
This is one of the project I did when I was starting to learn Machine learning. The project involves simple machine learning algorithm used to predict sales values. The dataset were taken from kaggle. It implements exisitng models such as linear regression to forecast data. 

**Note: Some modification has been in this project. Based on rubric: to improve accuracy to models I have applied the Bayesian Ridge Reression model where the marginal likelihood is used to estimate the parameters of the regression model. Both of the code demonstration is stored inside file. The implementation of marginal likelihood is done on same model which can be seen from the PART-2 inside 2_Sales_forecasting.ipynb file**
